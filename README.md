# CPS109-A1
 This was my first programming assignment in my Intro to programming class (CPS 109). For this assignmnet I created a simple bank that allows a user to either withdraw
 money into their account or to take out a loan. At the top of the assignmnet I have throughly explained how the bank works, so you can click on that to get a better 
 understanding of the assignment.
